# Recursion Programs in C++

This project demonstrates basic recursion in C++ with two programs:
1. **Factorial Calculator** – Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
2. **Sum Calculator** – Computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using recursion.

## 📌 Things I Learned
- Understanding the concept of **recursion** and how recursive functions work.
- Writing effective **base cases** to avoid infinite recursion.
- Applying recursion to solve **mathematical problems**.
- Handling **user input** and displaying output using C++.
- Writing **clean, well-commented code** for better readability.

## 🖥️ How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Compile using a C++ compiler like `g++`:
